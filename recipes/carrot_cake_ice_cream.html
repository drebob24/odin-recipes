            <h2>Ingredients</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>2 tbsps unsalted butter</li>
                <li>1 1/4 cups finely shredded carrots</li>
                <li>1/3 cup brown sugar</li>
                <li>1/4 tsp kosher salt</li>
                <li>1 1/4 tsps cinnamon</li>
                <li>1/2 tsp ground ginger</li>
                <li>4 oz soft cream cheese</li>
                <li>1 can (14 oz) sweetened condensed milk</li>
                <li>1 tsp vanilla extract</li>
                <li>2 1/4 cups heavy cream</li>
                <li>1/3 cup toasted chopped pecans</li>
                <li>1/3 cup chopped walnuts</li>
            </ul>
       
        </div>
        

        <p><h2>Steps</h2></p>
            <ol>
                <li>Combine butter, carrots, brown sugar, and salt in a saucepan over medium heat. Cook and stir until carrots are just getting tender, about 5 minutes. Season with cinnamon and ginger. Cook for 1 more minute. Turn off heat, and let cool.</li>
                <li>Meanwhile, whisk together cream cheese, sweetened condensed milk, and vanilla extract in a bowl until smooth. Stir in cooled carrot mixture and transfer to the refrigerator until needed.</li>
                <li>Beat cream in a chilled glass or metal bowl with an electric mixer until medium-stiff  peaks form. Add cooled carrot-cream cheese mixture and whisk into the whipped cream. Fold in chopped walnuts and pecans with a spatula.</li>
                <li>Transfer mixture into a chilled airtight container and place a piece of plastic wrap directly onto the mixture. Cover with a lid and freeze until solid, at least 4 hours, but best overnight.</li>
            </ol>
